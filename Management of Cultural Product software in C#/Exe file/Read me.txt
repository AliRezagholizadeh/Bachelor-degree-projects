The following files are done by me in our group and written in c sharp language programming: 
'Book.cs', 'CD.cs', 'Cossette.cs', 'Documents.cs', 'ExecuteQuery.cs', 'Gallery.cs', 'Magazine.cs', 'NewsPaper.cs', 'Paper.cs', 'Program.cs',
'Search.cs', 'Verifications.cs', 'Video.cs' 
I had to manage the linking to database portion.
